# Writing an R package:
## Tools--R packages to create R packages
1. **`devtools`** is a collection of R package developmental tools
    - For example `create("project")` creates a project folder for your R package
2. **`usethis`** creates things for package management
    - For example `use_r("file_name")` creates an ***.R*** file
3. **`roxygen`** generates documentations

More on how to use these packages below... ...

## HOW to Create an R Package:
1. Navigate to the desired project location with `setwd()` in RStudio
2. Use `devtools::create("<project_name>")` to create a new R project. It will create 
the following files inside the project folder:
    - an ***R folder***
    - ***DESCRIPTION***
    - ***NAMESPACE***
    - ***<project_name>.Rproj***
      - If existing project doesn't have an ***.Rproj*** file, create one with `devtools::use_rstudio("<path/to/package>")`.
     ***.Rproj*** file contains project option information
    - ***.gitignore***
    - ***.Rbuildignore***
3. Work on the ***DESCRIPTION*** file, reference for details [here](https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/hadley/r-pkgs/description.html):
    - Modify **Title** and **Description** accordingly (**Note:** values span multiple 
  lines in the ***DESCRIPTION*** file needs four spaces indent)
    - Modify **Authors@R** with `person("first_name", "last_name", email = ..., role = c("aut", "cre"))`
    - Use `devtools::use_package("package_name")` to add package dependency to **Import:** 
    - Use `devtools::use_package("package_name", "Suggests")` to add package to **Suggests:**
    - If any of your functions provides the option to use the suggested package, 
    check if the package is installed with `requireNamespace("package_name", quietly=TRUE)` 
    - Use `devtools::use_build_ignore("note")` to modify the ***.Rbuildignore*** file
4. Add functions to ***.R*** files in the ***R folder***:
    - `use_this::use_r("file_name")` to creat a blank ***.R*** file in the R folder
    - Tips and tricks for functions:
      - Variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs
      - Use two spaces when indent your code
      - Comments should explain the why, not the what
      - Use `#------` to break up your code into easily readable chunks
    - Add function documentation:
      - Title in the format of `#' @title <fxn title>`
      - Description in the format of `#' @description <fxn description>`
      - Parameter(s) in the format of `#' @param <name> <description>`
      - Output in the format of `#' @return <fxn outupt>`
      - Example of how function is used in the format of `#' @example(s) <example>`
      (**Note:** example will need to pass check if it's added to documentation)
      - Don't forget to `#' @export`
      ![Example](/Users/sarazzzz/Desktop/R/rdev/szrtools/imgs/fun_doc_example.png)
    - `devtools::document()` creates the nicely formatted function documentations, 
    which are in the Rd files, and they could be converted to HTML or [PDF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3779864/how-do-i-convert-rd-files-to-pdf-for-a-package-that-i-am-creating-in-r)
    - use template .R file or template documentation (`#'@template file_name`), or documentation referencing (`#'@inheritParams function_name`)
    for consistent function documentation
5. To add the **`magrittr`** pipe, use `usethis::use_pipe()`
6. Add files/directories to ***.Rbuildignore*** if they should not be distributed
    - `usethis::use_build_ignore("<file/directory_name>")`
7. Build package with `devtools::build()`
8. Check package for errors, warnings, and notes with `devtools::check()`
9. Use GitHub Actions to check codes add to the repo:
    - `usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()` for standard check
    - `usethis::use_github_action_check_release()` for quick check
    - Either function creates a `.github` folder, a `workflows` folder with a 
  `R-CMD-check.yaml` file inside, and a `R-CMD-check` badge will be added to the
  `README.md`

## How to Consistently Document R Functions
### Create a Template .R File 
**Reference:** [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35158708/how-to-set-default-template-for-new-r-files-in-rstudio)

1. First create a ***template folder*** in the ***.config folder***
    - `cd ~/.config/rstudio`
    - `mkdir template`
2. Then create a ***default.R*** file
    - `cd template`
    - `touch default.R`
    - `open default.R` and add to the ***default.R*** file
    
### Create a Template Doc File
1. First create a ***man-roxygen folder*** in the project folder
2. Add the folder to the ***.Rbuildignore*** 
    - `usethis::use_build_ignore("man-roxygen")`
3. Create template documentation .R file
    - For example, "#'@param var_x blah blah blah" to var_x.R


## Understand the WHYs
**Reference:** first edition of [R Packages](https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/hadley/r-pkgs/index.html), 
second edition is work in progress.

1. What is the difference between `devtools` and `usethis`? [Hmmm](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1985)
2. Five states of a package:
    - **source:** local development version of a package 
    - **bundled:** package that's compressed to a single file, it's created by calling 
  `devtools::build()`. Files added to *".Rbuildignore"* are not included in the bundle.
   Package bundle is generated for code distribution!?
    - **binary:** similar to package bundle that it's compressed to a single file,
   but its internal structure is rearranged from a source package. Binary package 
   is generated for distribution that `install.packages()` download and install 
   binary packages built by CRAN.
    - **installed:** is a binary package decompressed into a package library
    - **in memory:** load installed package to memory
3. What is a library? A directory containing installed packages. Library varies based 
on the version of R. When upgrade R, all packages need to be re-install not because 
they disappear, but only that R cannot find them.
4. What is the difference between `devtools::load_all()` and "Build & Reload"?
    - `devtools::load_all()` sources all files in ***R/***
5. What is the difference between `library()` and `require()`? When a package is 
not found, `library()` throws an error but `require()` prints a message and returns
`FALSE`.
6. When a package is built, code in ***R/*** is executed and the results are saved. 
They are made available to use when package is loaded with `library()` or `require()`.
7. `DESCRIPTION` lists the packages your package needs. Specify required packages 
in `DESCRIPTION$Imports` and they will be installed when your package is installed.
List suggested packages under `DESCRIPTION$Suggests`, those are the packages can be 
used but not required (Not sure if I understand the difference since I would have `suggested_package::fxn` even for functions from the suggested packages in my codes, 
right?! Okay, I think it means if you have an alternative execution to `suggested_package::fxn`, 
you can let your package users know that they can use the `suggested_package::fxn` 
with your fxns).
**For examples:** 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Here you are telling your package users that they need to install the suggested_pkg.
# Why not put the package under Imports?? If the suggested package is only required 
# by one less-frequently-used function among many of your other functions, maybe it's 
# a good idea to let the users install the suggested package when they need it.
# When developing package locally, you don't really need to use Suggests.
fxn <- function(x, y) {
  if (!requireNamespace("suggested_pkg", quietly = TRUE)) {
    stop("Suggested_pkg needed for this function. Please install it.", call. = FALSE)
  }
}

# Here you have an alternative execution, but user could also choose to use the 
# suggested package
fxn <- function(x, y) {
  if (!requireNamespace("suggested_pkg", quietly = TRUE)) {
    suggested_pkg::fxn()
  } else {
    fxn()
  }
}
```

8. Version of the required packages under **Imports:** can be specified like this:
```{r eval=FALSE}
Imports: 
  pakcage_x (>= version_of_the_pacakge_you_are_using_for_development)
```
It's important to specify the version of required packages when you release your package
since users might not have the required version installed.
9. 
10. R environment is changed sometimes with function calls, for examples, `library()`, `options()`, and `setwd()`
